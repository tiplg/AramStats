# AramStats
Tools to find ARAM game stats. Used for [HowlingAbyss.xyz](http://howlingabyss.xyz).

GameFinder uses the GAME-V1.3 API to find aram gameids. It also uses the same api to find the summonerids of aram player for future scraping of gameids.

StatScraper uses the MATCH-V2.2 to record the stats of aram games. These stats are entered in a database per champion. This database can be used on the website to display statistics per champions such as win rate, pick rate and average cs.

Both will be moved to the MATCH-V3 API when RiotSharp gets updated.

Data is saved in a Mysql database.
